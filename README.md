# Objective:

Every passing day we can see that the car market is increasing rapidly and that brings us to a door where many people are buying and selling the cars in the market, so to make this process more fluid and with a better market view, I am proposing a model which will take particular information related to the car and will predict the selling price. This will help to get a better view while buying and selling cars.
